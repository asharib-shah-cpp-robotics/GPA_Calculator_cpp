# GPA_Calculator_cpp
A dual-mode C++ GPA/CGPA calculator suite featuring a high-logic CLI version and an interactive GUI for SGPA tracking. Demonstrates core C++ concepts and visual implementation.
# Comprehensive GPA Calculator Suite (C++)

A robust C++ project developed to simplify academic performance tracking. This repository showcases the transition from core logic implementation to Graphical User Interface (GUI) development.

## 🚀 Features

### 1. Console-Based (CLI) Version
* **Dual Calculation:** Supports both **SGPA** (Semester Grade Point Average) and **CGPA** (Cumulative Grade Point Average).
* **Dynamic Logic:** Uses arrays and loops to handle multiple subjects and semester data accurately.
* **Precision:** Implements high-precision floating-point arithmetic for exact grading.

### 2. GUI-Based Version
* **User-Friendly Interface:** A graphical approach to calculating **SGPA**.
* **Visual Logic:** Demonstrates the integration of C++ logic with graphical components.
* **Interactive UX:** Simplifies data entry for students who prefer a visual tool.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Concepts
* **Language:** C++
* **Logic:** Arrays, Loops, Nested Conditionals, and Functions.
* **GUI Framework:** [Yahan framework ka naam likho, e.g., WinBGIM, Qt, ya SFML]
* **Development:** Focus on modular code and logic scalability.

## 📂 Project Structure
* `Simple_GPA_CGPA.cpp`: Core logic for comprehensive academic tracking.
* `GUI_SGPA_Tool.cpp`: Graphical implementation for semester-wise tracking.
